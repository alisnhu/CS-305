Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
client, Artemis Financial. Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.
Artemis Financial is focused on updating its operations and enhancing the security of its software, especially for its RESTful API. 
They requested assistance in identifying and addressing potential security weaknesses in their web-based application.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
What I think I do best in these projects is to examine existing codes and to see the mistakes made in advance and address them.
Effectively identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities is essential for safeguarding against external attacks. 
Secure coding is critical because it protects data integrity, ensures privacy, and strengthens the overall security framework of a company.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
One of the main challenges was applying multliple layer of security to one project and follow standarts.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To enhance security, I implemented multi-layered defenses such as strong encyption protocols and secure coding standards. 
In the future, I would rely on tools like automated vulnerability scanners and threat modeling techniques to identify risks and select appropriate mitigation strategies.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After refining the code, I will conduct extensive testing to confirm that no new vulnerabilities will be  introduced. 
This involves using static analysis tools and performing penetration tests to verify the application's security.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Static testing tools deffinetly willbe helpfull in the future.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

To demonstrate my skills to future employers, 
I would present the vulnerability assessment report and the successful implementation of security enhancements that maintained application performance, 
highlighting my capability to secure and optimize software systems.
